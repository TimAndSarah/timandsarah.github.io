## Children
Although we love your little ones, this is an adult only affair.

## Dress Code
The dress code is formal attire. We suggest that men wear a suit and tie, and women wear a cocktail dress or dressy separates. The ceremony will be outdoors (weather permitting!) so please bring a jacket---maximum temperatures during October are around 20&deg;C. If the weather is looking a bit bleak weâ€™ll hold both the ceremony and reception indoors at the Boat House.
