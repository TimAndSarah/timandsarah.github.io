# Accommodation

Here are some recommendations for accommodation for out-of-towners. The Boat House gave us discount codes for guests to use. 

Our wedding is on a long weekend and coincides with [Floriade](https://floriadeaustralia.com/), Canberra’s annual flower festival. So we’d recommend booking your accommodation sooner rather than later.
