## Children
Although we love your little ones, this is an adult only affair.

## Dress Code
The dress code is formal attire. We suggest that men wear a suit and tie, and women wear a cocktail dress or dressy separates. The ceremony will be outdoors (weather permitting!) so please bring a jacket---maximum temperatures during October are around 20&deg;C. If the weather is looking a bit bleak we’ll hold both the ceremony and reception indoors at the Boat House.

## RSVP
Please send your RSVP to <a>TimAndSarahWedding2024@gmail.com</a> by 6 August 2024. Please let us know of any dietary requirements.

## Gifts
Your presence on our wedding day is the best gift of all, and we’re so grateful for the effort you’ve put it to join us and make our day so special. However, if you were thinking of giving a gift to help us start our next chapter, we will have a wishing well at our reception.

## Do you have plans on Saturday evening?
We'll be hanging out at [Verity Lane Market](https://veritylanemarket.com.au/) from 5-8pm on Saturday 5th October, the day before the wedding, please feel free to come say hello! [Food](https://veritylanemarket.com.au/our-vendors/) and drink will be available to purchase.
