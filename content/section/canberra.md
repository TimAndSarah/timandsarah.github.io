 - [Capital Brewing](https://capitalbrewing.co/) A bit out of town but nice spot for a cheeky beer.

## To do (in Canberra)

 - [Floriade](https://floriadeaustralia.com/), Canberra’s annual flower festival.
 - Walk around the lake, perhaps stopping in at the [National Library](https://www.nla.gov.au/) or [the Jetty](https://thejettycbr.com/) for a coffee/drink.
 - [Arboretum](https://www.nationalarboretum.act.gov.au/): Pretty spot for a walk and coffee with tonnes of trees from around the world. There’s a great playground for the kiddos and be sure to check out the Bonsai tree exhibition!
 - [National Gallery](https://nga.gov.au/) and [Portrait Gallery](https://www.portrait.gov.au/) 
 - Walk up Mount Ainslie for some lovely views across Canberra

## To do (around Canberra)

 - Visit a winery: We really like [Shaw](https://shawwines.com.au/), [Four Winds](https://www.fourwindsvineyard.com.au/) (does killer wood fired pizzas for lunch), and [Clonakilla](https://clonakilla.com.au/). [Mount Majura Vineyard](https://www.mountmajura.com.au/) is closer to Canberra but not quite as good as the others.
 - Visit the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve. Tons of lovely [walking trails](https://www.tidbinbilla.act.gov.au/do/walking-trails), we like [Square Rock](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/australian-capital-territory/square-rock). Guaranteed Australian animal sightings at [the Sanctuary](https://www.tidbinbilla.act.gov.au/do/the-sanctuary) and [Eucalypt Forest](https://www.tidbinbilla.act.gov.au/do/the-eucalypt-forest).
